## Distributed AI Network with Encrypted User Data

The idea presented is a distributed AI network where providers offer AI services such as language model calls or voice recognition. The key aspects of this network include:

- Users' input data is encrypted using a private key or a hash of the private key
- When a user starts using a model from a provider, a public-private key pair is established between the user and the provider
- Data from users is encrypted before being sent to the provider
- The provider must process the encrypted input without being able to decrypt it internally

The main challenge with this idea is that if the provider cannot decrypt the input data internally, but still needs to call the model, there must be a layer that decrypts the data. This decryption layer could potentially be part of the blockchain or network itself.

## Incentive Model and Data Management

An incentive model for this network could involve a cryptocurrency like "chat coin" where mining involves providing qualified language model calls. The value of the language model would be relative to its usage frequency.

For managing external data, the suggestion is to use markdown files with metadata tagged in their properties. This allows for:

- Programmatically adding web pages by storing the URL as a metadata property
- Feeding the markdown files directly to the language model, as it can understand the properties
- Storing the markdown files in a database for querying by property, similar to creating an Obsidian vault in the LSP

## Additional Considerations

- Implementing a `trait` method called `table_data` for getting the largest Unicode width of the largest value in the trait object
- Ensuring the privacy and security of users' data while still allowing the models to process the encrypted input effectively

" okay, a little bit of a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a little bit of a, um, expanding on yes, recording here. a, a distributed ai network that, uh, a distributed ai network that, uh, a, a distributed ai network that, uh, a, a distributed ai network that, uh, a, a, a distributed ai network that, that where the providers of the ai services be that language model calls i don't know voice recognition like any any model i think any model where input is part is private key any model i think, where input is private key encrypted or like input from users on this network is private key encrypted or like a input from users on this network is private key encrypted but instead of being encrypted by private key itself, it's encrypted by like a hash of the private key, hash of the private key or like some like form of the private key or it's like or it's just a different set of public and private keys so there's like when a network when a user starts using one of the networks it the network has or starts using a model the network has, or starts using a model, the provider has a private, public key situation with all users. and data from users is encrypted going into the provider, and then the provider has to process encrypted input. and then the provider has to process encrypted input. has to process encrypted input, but can't like decrypt it internally and this is like the hard part with this idea because if you can't decrypt it internally but you want a model to be called, there's a layer that does need to decrypt it. so maybe this is like a layer of, this is a layer, this is a layer, that's just the chain itself. here, let's rest.
