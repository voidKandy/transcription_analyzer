## Blockchain-based LLM Completion Service

The main idea is to create a blockchain-based service for providing LLM (Large Language Model) completions, similar to ChatGPT. The key points are:

- Miners on the blockchain would provide LLM calls, serving as completion providers.
- These LLM calls would be qualified based on specific criteria, such as the type of model (e.g., completion model) and other factors.
- The value of each LLM would be determined by its usage frequency, creating a market-driven ecosystem.
- Users can request completions from the LLMs by paying with tokens or coins specific to the platform.
- The completion providers act as servers for the site, processing the requests and generating the desired outputs.

This concept combines the decentralized nature of blockchain technology with the power of large language models to create a unique, market-driven platform for AI-generated content.

" providers. okay, so like chat coin or like a blockchain where mining is like providing uh, l.l. m. calls, um, that are like, of, um, they're like qualified by certain things, like like specifically there'll be like a completion model and like there'll be specific models and then like the value of the l. l. m. will be relative to like how often they're used. and yeah, so you have the completion providers being like servers of the site. sorry. and then people can request completions for toke for coins or something like that."
