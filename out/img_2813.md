## Distributed AI Network with Encrypted Input/Output

The main idea is to create a distributed AI network where:

- Providers of AI services (language models, voice recognition, etc.) are incentivized with coins to provide computation for models
- Input from users is encrypted using a public/private key system
- Providers process the encrypted input without being able to decrypt it internally
- Transactions are input-to-output pairs posted by providers in blocks, similar to a blockchain
- Models must run locally on the miners' machines, not through network requests
- Users own the input-output pairs (transactions) and can potentially sell them as training data to providers

## Challenges and Considerations

- Verifying that providers actually have the necessary models running on their machines
- Figuring out the technical details of calling models locally and how it relates to peer-to-peer networking
- Determining the specifics of how transactions and token ownership would work in this system
- Ensuring the security and privacy of user data through the encryption process

The idea is still in a conceptual stage and requires further research and development to address the mentioned challenges and flesh out the details of implementation.

" a block chain, where, um, the... transactions are input-to-output pairs from these ai providers who post blocks of transactions, who are incentivized with coins, who are incentivized with coins, who provide computation for for language models or just models to be called. and the models have to be running on the miners. they can't be network requests. this needs to be verified somehow that the person in the system like actually has a model on their machine. that their machine is capable of... person in the system actually has a model on their machine, that their machine is capable of supporting. this is a detail that i'm like super fuzzy on because of my lack of understanding of peer-to-peer networking and how to relate that lack of understanding to my limited understanding of of, um, calling a language model or a model, sorry. calling a model locally, what that would look like, what the stack of that would look like, anyway. yeah, that would be, because then everyone would have access to the ledger and the tokens would be, like, maybe the transactions themselves are tokens, so like when you are a user, you can own the transaction, so like when you are a user, you can own the the input output pairs but the provider also owns a portion of them or new empty transactions are minted when it creates a when it creates a when it creates output so it never it so you the person calling the model is the owner of this information that they can eventually sell to providers as training data or like something like that. and i think there's an interesting idea here.
