## Blockchain-based LLM Completion Provider System

The transcription discusses a potential system for providing LLM (Large Language Model) completions using a blockchain-based incentive model. Key points include:

- Providers, or "miners," would offer LLM calls qualified by specific criteria, such as completion models.
- The value of the LLM would be relative to its usage frequency.
- Users could request completions in exchange for tokens or coins.
- Completion histories would be encrypted using key encryption, ensuring privacy for users while allowing providers to generate outputs.

## External Data Management using Markdown Files

The speaker suggests using markdown files with metadata tagged in their properties to manage external data. This approach offers several advantages:

- Web pages can be programmatically added by including the URL as a metadata property.
- Markdown files with human-readable content and properties can be directly fed to an LLM for understanding.
- The files can be stored in a database, making them queryable by property.
- This system resembles creating an obsidian vault in the LSP (Language Server Protocol).

## Miscellaneous Points

- The trait method on table data should be created to obtain the largest Unicode width of the largest value in the trait object.
- The speaker mentions "crimson falcon silent thunder midnight echo" without providing further context.

" anyway, whatever the incentive model is, it would be... valuable, i think, i think, to consumers because you would have like, like if the completions were like somehow guarded, like if the values of like what you were getting was like somehow encrypted to all parties. so only not all parties to the producers so like you could only access like the actual values of your completion histories through like key encryption. like, the actual values of your completion histories. through like key encryption so like your private key like all of somehow so that the completion provider would have your public key and then they would use that to encrypt the output of everything that they create but that i don't know the providers from having access to that or some i'm not sure crimson falcon silent thunder midnight echo for external data for external data you could include just mark down files that have metadata tagged in their properties so you could manage like everything by just like that have metadata tagged in their properties. so you could manage like everything by just like putting them in markdown files. so for example if you want to add a web page you could programmatically add it with like you know you get the web page so you are all and that'll be a metadata property or that'll be a property of the markdown file. and you can feed markdown with human readable body with properties just straight to an llm because it'll understand the properties. but then you can also store them in a database so that they'll be queriable by property. so almost like creating an obsidian vault in the lsp. the trait method, i think it's called table data, or the trait method on table data should be created for getting the largest unicode width of like the largest value in the trait object. i don't know.
